### Trilium-based Personal Site
Personal site running off two key backend sources:
1. [Trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium), an excellent note-taking program, which is used to generate blog content
2. [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) to generate the static site at the blog and non-blog level.

Still very much a WIP, further documentation to come
